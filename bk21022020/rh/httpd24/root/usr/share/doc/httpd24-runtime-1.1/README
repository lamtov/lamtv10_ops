NAME
       httpd24  -  manual page for httpd24 Software Collection

SYNOPSIS
       systemctl start httpd24-httpd

DESCRIPTION
       Package httpd24 provides Apache httpd web server as a Software Collection.
       For  more  information  about  Software Collections, see the scl(1) man
       page. By installing the httpd24 collection, you will get the minimum
       working set of packages to have a working Apache httpd web server.

       Software	 Collections  allows use of applications which are not located
       in the filesystem root hierarchy but  are  present  in  an  alternative
       location, which is /opt/rh/httpd24/root in case of the httpd24 collection.

       When  you  want to  work  with the httpd24 collection, use the scl
       utility (see the scl(1) man page for usage) to enable the scl  environ‐
       ment.

EXAMPLES
       scl enable httpd24 'command --arg'

	      Run  a  specific command  with  the argument  --arg within the
	      httpd24 software collections environment.

       scl enable httpd24 bash

	      Run  an  interactive shell with the httpd24 software collec‐
	      tion enabled.

       scl enable httpd24 'man httpd'

	      Show man pages for the httpd command, which is  a part  of  the
	      httpd24 software collection.
