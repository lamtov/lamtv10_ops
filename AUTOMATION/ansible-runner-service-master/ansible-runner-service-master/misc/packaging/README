EL7 build

Assumptions
- you have a valid rpmbuild environment!


Known Issues
- using the rpm depends on 1.1.1 of ansible_runner - but this isn't currently
  available outside pip, so the spec file is currently missing the dependency
  on ansible_runner
- these steps cover a manual build process and as such the spec may need to
  change to support automated rpm build environments.


Building your rpm based on the 0.8 release
- copy .spec file to your SPECS directory
- download from github to SOURCES directory using spectool
  spectool -g -R -d '_version 0.8' -d '_release 0' SPECS/ansible-runner-service.spec
- cd SPECS and build the rpm with
  rpmbuild -bb --define '_version 0.8' --define '_release 0' ansible-runner-service.spec


Build Environment
CentOS7


Resulting RPM Tested Against
- CentOS 7.4, Python 2.7.5


Container build

The <ars_source.spec> file allows to produce an rpm to install Ansible Runner Service without any dependency.
This is specially suited for use in containers where the dependencies are going to be especified directly in the Dockerfile.
