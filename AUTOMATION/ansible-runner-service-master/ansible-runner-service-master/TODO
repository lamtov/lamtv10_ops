Security on the Api
- should we hold a small db (sqlite3) containing users/password/tokens/expiry date
- cache the credentials to prevent repeated i/o to sqlite db
- have a login api endpoint, that returns a token
- all normal requests must use the tokens - fail basicauth
- could support multiple users with a db, and token architecture
- with expiring tokens the "exploit window" is reduced
- use https as the api endpoint

What to do about Hosts?
- post - hostname and root password in the payload, extend utils.py/SSHClient class?
                   passwordless ssh - return 200 if login successful
- put request update a host to belong to a given groups

Should all POSTs optionally expect a host= parameter to restrict the runner
- check that the host given in in /etc/ansible/hosts first :)


What about DoS?
- should we record the frequency of the calls, and if too much just abort the request?
